# Assignment 4:  DIY Calculator

_Note: These instructions contain formatting that does not render nicely in raw text formats (e.g., TextEdit or Notepad).  VSCode offers a markdown viewer window that will format the text for you._

In this assignment, you will practice using stacks in a real parsing application: computing the result of arithmetic expressions.
To start, you will read an expression in postfix notation (e.g. `3 2 + 5 *`) and use an `ArrayDeque` as a stack to compute the result.
In the end, you will build a calculator that can handle both infix (what weâ€™re all accustomed to) and postfix notations.

In addition to stacks, we'll also use queues for passing tokens between different parts of our program.

## Specifications

Your first program will be able to read a postfix expression and compute the result:

	Input: "3 2 + 5 *"
	Answer: 25
    
Your second program will read an infix expression and compute the result:

	Input: "(3+2)*5"
	Answer: 25

For grading, we will run the methods you write by testing, though you are welcome to create a m]TRain method if it's helpful.

### Stack and Queue Implementations
For this assignment, we will use instances of the Java built-in `ArrayDeque` class (see [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html)) to serve as either a stack or a queue.
Although we will be using the same underlying implementation for both, we will be using some objects only as queues and other objects only as stacks.
To help keep things from getting confusing, we recommend naming your variables like this:
- `ArrayDeque<Object> stack`: we'll make use of the `addFirst(...)` and `removeFirst()` methods to use this one as a **stack**
- `ArrayDeque<Object> queue`: we'll make use of the `addLast(...)` and `removeFirst()` methods to use this one as a **queue**

_**Warning**: Java also has a now-obsolete `Stack` class (see [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)) but we do not endorse using it for this assignment, or really anything else.
If you want to get into the details of why this is, check out [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-deque-vs-stack)._

## Phase 1: Tokenization
We will be reading the mathematical expressions in as `String`.
Included, you will find code for a `Tokenizer` that includes a `readTokens` method that will parse equations provided as strings and return a queue of the individual components.
This method will separate numbers, operators, parentheses, etc. and put them into a queue.
The queue will allow us to operate on them one at a time.
You may want to play around with setting up this kind of `Scanner` in `Main.java` to make sure you understand how it works before moving on to Phase 1.

### The `instanceof` operator
You may notice that this input queue will hold data of heterogeneous types: `Double` for the numbers, and `Character` for the operators.
Because `Double` and `Character` are both subclasses of the `Object` class, you can store both in the input queue, which is of type `ArrayDeque<Object>`.
At various points in this assignment, however, you'll want to differentiate the `Double`s from the operators (type `Character`).
To accomplish this, use the `instanceof` operator.
For example,  `x instanceof Character` has the value `true` if `x` is of type `Character`.
Likewise, `x instanceof Double` has the value `true` if `x` is of type `Double`.

In the methods you are implementing, your stacks will only hold one type (`Double` in Postfix and `Character` in Infix).
Make sure you handle type consistently; for example, in Postfix, you can use an `ArrayDeque<Double>` as your stack and then just make sure you cast the elements to type `Double` as you add them (e.g., `(Double) token`).

## Phase 2: Postfix Computation 
![HP "No Equals" hat](Hewlett-Packard_No_Equals_hat.jpg "Postfix Hat")

For Phase 2, you will join the "No Equals" team (see the vintage Hewlett Packard postfix-enthusiast hat in the photo above) and use `Postfix.java` to calculate the solution to a postfix equation.
For example, "3 2 + 5 \*" corresponds to (3+2)\*5 in our standard infix notation. 

The first step in processing the input expression will be to parse the tokens and store them in a queue (see Phase 1 above).
Once you have done that, use the algorithm below to compute the value of the postfix expression:

* Take a token one at a time from the queue and process it as follows:
  * If the token is a **number**, `push(...)` it onto the stack
  * If the token is an **operator**, `pop()` two numbers off the stack, combine them using the **operator**, and `push(...)` the result back onto the stack
* Once all the tokens have been processed in this way, the stack should contain exactly one element: the result.

If the stack runs out of elements needed for processing an operator, or if there are too many items on the stack at the end, then the starting expression was malformed and you should throw an exception to report the error.
The tests assume that you will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` in these cases.

You should implement this method as a method called `postfix` within the `Postfix.java` class.
Make sure your postfix calculator is passing all of the tests in the `PostfixTest` class before you move on to Phase 3.

*Note: Remember that the first `Double` you pop will be the second number in your equation.*

## Phase 3: Infix Computation
Handling infix expressions is more complicated because you have to deal with parentheses.
However, infix expressions can be converted (parentheses and all) into postfix ones using a single stack. 
In this stage, you will once again parse a string containing an equation using `Tokenizer.readTokens()`.
The end result will be a queue of `Doubles` and `Characters` consistent with the format of a postfix expression (e.g., you will convert `(3 + 2) * 5` to `3 2 + 5 *`).
Therefore, you can just call your `Postfix.postfix` method you wrote in Phase 2 to do all of the actual math, and if your Phase 2 code passes all the tests, you should be able to just call the method without any changes. 

You will write a method in the `Infix` class called `infixToPostfix`.
In this stage, as soon as you read a `Double` from the input queue, you can put it directly into the output queue to send to `Postfix.postfix`.
Instead, you will add the operators (type `Character`) to a stack and use the order of operations (`PEMDAS`) to determine how you process them.
The outline below is a simplified version (ignoring operator associativity) of the full shunting yard algorithm given on Wikipedia: [Shunting-yard algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shunting-yard_algorithm&oldid=572362024).
You may find this article helpful to give you some additional context about the steps needed.s

_Note: to follow this implementation, you will need **two** instances of type `ArrayDeque<Object>`: one that will operate as a stack, and another that will operate as a queue._

* While there are tokens to be read:

  * Read a token.

  * If the token is a number, then add it to the output queue.

  * If the token is an operator (the "queue operator") then:

	* while there is an operator token at the top of the stack (the "stack operator"), and the stack operator has GREATER THAN OR EQUAL precedence than the queue operator,

  	* pop the stack operator off the stack and add it to the output queue;

	* when no more high-precedence stack operators remain, finally push the queue operator onto the stack.

  * If the token is a left parenthesis, then push it onto the stack.

  * If the token is a right parenthesis:
	* Until the token at the top of the stack is a left parenthesis, pop operators off the stack onto the output queue.

	* Pop the left parenthesis from the stack, but not onto the output queue.

	* If the stack runs out without finding a left parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.

* When there are no more tokens to read:
  * While there are still tokens in the stack:
	* If the token on the top of the stack is a parenthesis, then there are mismatched parentheses.

	* If it is an operator, pop it onto the output queue.
* Exit.

Once again, you want to make sure you think about when you'd like this program to throw exceptions.
Once the algorithm is implemented, you should be able to send the now-populated output queue directly to your postfix-processing method in `Postfix.java` to compute the result of an infix equation that uses parentheses as well as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
You don't have to write any additional functions to do math in this class, as Postfix should be able to handle all the actual computation.

## Phase 4: Left- vs. Right-Associativity
The shunting-yard pseudocode given above will work for the operators `+` `-` `*` and `/` but not for `^` (exponentiation).
While the first four operators are left-associative, the latter is right-associative and therefore needs slightly different treatment.
What does left-associative mean?
We interpret 1+2+3 as (1+2)+3. On the other hand, 2^1^3 is interpreted as 2^(1^3) because ^ is right-associative.
The strategy for implementing left-associative operations is described in the full Shunting-Yard pseudocode under the Wikipedia link, but it boils down to using less than in the precedence comparison rather than less than or equal to.

To earn the last point on the checklist, your program should implement the complete shunting-yard algorithm linked above from Wikipedia, including associativity.
This approach will involve only a small change in the code you implemented from the simplified algorithm you implemented in Phase 3.
Remember that you will also need to  make sure you add exponents into your `Postfix` code as well, though.
(You might want to use `Math.pow()` for the actual calculation.)
